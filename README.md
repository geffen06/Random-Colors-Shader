# Random-Colors-Shader
Using p5js and glsl I created a shader that rounds the brightness of each pixel, uses the rounded brightness to pick from pre-chosen colors and then uses the actual brightness to fade between them using linear interpolation. 

Instructions: 
Click on the screen after running the program, then press any key to change the color
The '1' key will give primarily red colors
'2' will give green
'3' will give blue
any other key will bring it back to random
